## What’s Stakes.social?

Stakes.social is a platform where you can register your OSS to Dev Protocol and stake registered OSS projects. Unlike other donation services, Dev Protocol is designed for the benefit of both supporters as well as developers by staking. Thanks to this system, developers find it easy to ask people for aid, which results in continuous support.

## A guide to onboard

In this guideline, you’ll get an idea on the process of registering your OSS to Dev Protocol. We also mention points where you should be careful or might be puzzled to make it clear.

## Before you start

In order for you to register (or tokenize) your OSS to Dev Protocol, you need to go through a registration procedure for Stakes.social. You’ll need a wallet to register, so you must have one beforehand.

## What’s wallet?

A wallet is used for managing your crypto assets. You need to have a wallet to store DEV token issued by Ethereum and Dev Protocol. Since Dev Protocol doesn’t provide you with wallet function, you have to get one by yourselves.

If you’re looking for a wallet, we’d recommend you to have MetaMask.
MetaMask corresponds to Chrome Extension version, so if you want to use Stakes.social via your PC, MetaMask would be one of you options.

## Connection between your wallet and Stakes.social

Click “Sign in” button located at right end of the header to connect your wallet (MetaMask, in this case) and Stakes.social.

## Gas fee

Please check the following website for the details of gas fee : [https://devprotocol.xyz/faq](https://devprotocol.xyz/faq)
You need a gas fee to register at Stakes.social. It fluctuates depending on the congestion condition, however, you would need about 0.0436ETH.
