## What’s Stakes.social?

Stakes.social is a platform where you can register your OSS to Dev Protocol and stake registered OSS projects. Unlike other donation services, Dev Protocol is designed for the benefit of both supporters as well as developers by staking. Thanks to this system, developers find it easy to ask people for aid, which results in continuous support.

## A guide to onboard

In this guideline, you’ll get an idea on the process of registering your OSS to Dev Protocol. We also mention points where you should be careful or might be puzzled to make it clear.

## Before you start

In order for you to register (or tokenize) your OSS to Dev Protocol, you need to go through a registration procedure for Stakes.social. You’ll need a wallet to register, so you must have one beforehand.

## What’s wallet?

A wallet is used for managing your crypto assets. You need to have a wallet to store the DEV tokens issued by Ethereum and Dev Protocol. Since Dev Protocol doesn’t provide you with a wallet function, you have to get one by yourself.

If you’re looking for a wallet, we’d recommend you to have MetaMask.
MetaMask corresponds to Chrome Extension version, so if you want to use Stakes.social via your PC, MetaMask would be one of you options.

## Connection between your wallet and Stakes.social

Click “Sign in” button located at right end of the header to connect your wallet (MetaMask, in this case) and Stakes.social.

## OSS registration after screening

If you successfully pass the screening, access the URL written in the approval email.

:::note

You’ll need a gas fee for your registration. It fluctuates depending on the congestion condition, however, it would be around 0.0436ETH.  Before you’re moving on to the next step, you should prepare ETH in your wallet.

In this step for tokenization, we’ll issue your token. This is called Property Token. Your reward is allocated in accordance with the ownership ratio of Property Token.

> For example, if you have a co-developer for your OSS project, you can distribute your reward by splitting this token.

## Receiving more support

In order for you to get more support for your OSS, it is important to let people know your Stakes.social page. We’d recommend you to tweet, place a link at a donation page or write a blog post.

In Dev Protocol team and community, we’re talking with each other about the way to make an announcement of onboarding at Stakes.social. If you have any insights or ideas, please share them at [Dev Protocol Forum](https://community.devprotocol.xyz/).
