## What is Creator token?

Creators can issue their own creator tokens by tokenizing their creations.

Once you have issued your creator token, you will be able to access the following features:

- Manage OSS ownership and build your community DAO
- Sustainable funding and splitting creators’ rewards to its holders

## How to issue your creator tokens?

Creator tokens can be easily issued without any knowledge of blockchain. The three steps are as follows:

-  **Put the ownership information of your assets in an Dapp such as Stakes.social**

- **Share Creator tokens with your team**    

10 million creator tokens (fixed supply) will be issued. Of these, 5% will be sent to the Treasury which will be used for whole ecosystem, and the other 95% can be freely allocated by owners.

- **Collect staking**    

Both creators and supporters get rewards when your creation is getting supported. This is the first scheme that can raise funds on a sustainable basis rather than a limited number of times, unlike traditional donations or crowdfunding.
