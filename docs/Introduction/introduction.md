> What is the beginning of Dev Protocol?
>
> The inspiration for Dev Protocol came not from OSS, but from the Japanese traditional sector. In 2014, Founder found that traditional artisans, dealing with Japanese national treasures artifacts/architecture were economically undervalued, make only tenth of the revenue of an online game company, which led to us starting the challenge of Dev Protocol.
> In the existing economy, highly social activities are not paid for its true value. We believe in a world where creators' creativity is maximized.
