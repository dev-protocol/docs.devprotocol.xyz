## What is Property token?

Property tokens are ERC20 tokens you can issue at Dev Pprotocol. With property tokens, you can:

- Prove the ownership of your project.
- Earn your creator rewards.
- Divide your creator rewards with your team members.
- All of these functions are automatically done on blockchain.

## How to issue your Property tokens?

Property tokens can be easily issued without any knowledge of blockchain. Please use Niwa, a social token launcher built on Dev Protocol.

## Behind tokenization process with Khaos

Dev Protocol has unique built-in oracle “Khaos” that securely connects to all web platforms such as GitHub, YouTube, Spotify and STEAM.

- First, issue your creator token on a Dapp
- Generate a hash to conceal an API access token for web platforms
- “Proof of ownership” and activities outside the blockchain.

To provide completely unique “proof of ownership”, your assets will never be illicitly copied by anyone.
