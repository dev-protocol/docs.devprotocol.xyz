Dev Protocol is on-chain middleware created for a whole new ecosystem designed for Open Source Software (OSS). With Dev Protocol, anyone can start to monetise your creations without changing licenses, codes, and support. You can use the feature set in Stakes.social, the first official application of the Dev Protocol

### What is an ecosystem for OSS?

Socially useful assets can be monetised while keeping Decentralization there. It is a new economy designed to allow open assets to be economically valuable, as opposed to the current world where closed assets are paid for. Dev Protocol will be expanded in the future to cover not only OSS, but also research papers and all intellectual assets.

> What is the beginning of Dev Protocol?   
>
> The inspiration for Dev Protocol came not from OSS, but from the Japanese traditional sector. In 2014, Founder found that traditional artisans, dealing with Japanese national treasures artifacts/architecture were economically undervalued, make only tenth of the revenue of an online game company, which led to us starting the challenge of Dev Protocol.
> In the existing economy, highly social activities are not paid for its true value. We believe in a world where creators' creativity is maximized.
