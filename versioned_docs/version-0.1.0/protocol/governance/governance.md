# Basic concept of governance

## Fully on-chain

Governance in Dev Protocol is driven fully on-chain for all decisions.

:::note

Currently, only pre-defined variables are updated on-chain. See the [Upgrading code modules](/protocol/governance/upgrading-core-modules) page for core modules upgrades.

:::

## Governance scopes are not limit

Governance in Dev Protocol allows all source code updates, from predefined variables to core modules.

## Everything is code

All proposals should be guaranteed by code.

## Derive the optimal solution

Governance in Dev Protocol eliminates the shortcomings of majority voting by accepting multiple weighted votes.
