Dev Protocol has improvement proposal schemes "DIPs" through git. The DIPs' git remote repository is on GitHub.

https://github.com/dev-protocol/DIPs

All core modules and variables of the Dev Protocol are updated by on-chain governance with source code. By asking the community for pros and cons through governance before developing the source code, developers can stabilize their development direction.

> Currently, on-chain governance can only update some variables managed by Policy Contract
