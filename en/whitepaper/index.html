class="subtitle"></span><div class="self-center adjust dark:text-gray-400"><h2 id="the-world-that-dev-protocol-aims-for" tabindex="-1">The World that Dev Protocol Aims for</h2><p>Economic activities are built on top of many real world activities. These activities need investments to realize future growth and profit. Dev Protocol is a decentralized technology that fairly evaluates various activities that have not received an economic evaluation and realizes their autonomous distribution and sustainability through P2P trading and reward distribution.</p><h3 id="overview" tabindex="-1">Overview</h3><p>Individuals produce value through activities. Dev Protocol offers market, staking, and reward distribution features for tokenizing these activities and trading them through P2P. When activities are tokenized, the following is achieved.</p><ul><li>Market rewards are obtained based on the staked</li><li>A tokenized activity undergoes Staking (financial support) by third parties</li><li>Providing value as an incentive for Staking</li><li>Sharing properties with joint activity participants and distributing market rewards</li></ul><p>Staking is a new form of trading money that uses the inflation mechanism. Through staking, the sustainability of users’ activities is secured, and users receive value at zero financial cost. This is a mechanism that provides profit for all properties that had previously been released for free or through other indirect monetization mechanisms. Dev Protocol aims for a total value staked that surpasses donation activities that have been taking place through legal tender.</p><p>Dev Protocol transfers the formulation of its policy, which serves as the guiding principle for its governance, to the community so that it can be updated depending on the circumstances. Users can freely propose a new policy through the protocol. In order for a policy to take effect, approval must be granted through a vote of staking users(a.k.a. stakers). A policy can be related to a decision on the inflation rate and other aspects of the ecosystem. The current <a href="https://github.com/dev-protocol/protocol/blob/main/docs/POLICY.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">policy is here</a>.</p><h3 id="market" tabindex="-1">Market</h3><p>The market serves to provide assuring identity by certifying an individual’s activity on the blockchain. A market is created for each authentication target, and the community can propose the opening of new markets.</p><h3 id="tokenization" tabindex="-1">Tokenization</h3><p>As a premise, ownership of a user’s activities is certified to belong to the user in Dev Protocol. This differs from the model employed in existing web platforms, in which the platform owns the user data, and separates the ownership and utilization of properties. A property can be used infinitely through the application layer built on top of Dev protocol.</p><h3 id="tokenization-method" tabindex="-1">Tokenization Method</h3><p>By authenticating an external account that expresses ownership of the activity on Dev Protocol, users can define their activity as a “property” on the market and certify that they are the owner of the property. When authenticating a property, the user pays a commission in DEV that has been defined by the policy, and the commission that has been paid is instantly burned. Users can authenticate multiple properties and connect them to multiple markets.</p><h3 id="profit%2C-market-reward%2C-inflation%2C-deflation" tabindex="-1">Profit, Market Reward, Inflation, Deflation</h3><p>An owner of a Property receives a market reward based on the total staked of the property.<br>The flow of DEV in the protocol can be summarized through the following lifecycle. For simplicity, the owner of a Property is listed as an “activity participant,” and a third party who receives some form of utility is listed as a “user,” although a user can be classified as both.</p><ol><li>DEV is newly minted by an activity participant and undergoes inflation.</li><li>A user stakes the DEV for the activity participant.</li><li>The more staking that a Property collectes, the more DEV this activity participant can newly mint.</li><li>As a perk for staking, the activity participant can provide the user with utility optionally.</li><li>When the user cancels staking, the user is able to withdraw the staking amount, as well as a portion of the DEV that the activity participant obtained through the offering.</li></ol><p>The total amount of rewards is determined (dynamically or statically) based on the policy regarding the inflation rate for DEV. The <a href="https://github.com/dev-protocol/protocol/blob/main/docs/POLICY.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">current policy is here</a>. Through the protocol, DEV is newly issued, burned, staked, and fluctuates based on demand.</p><h3 id="shared-rights-with-joint-activity-participants" tabindex="-1">Shared Rights with Joint Activity Participants</h3><p>The owner of a Property initially owns 100% of the ownership rights. Owning 100% of the ownership rights is equivalent to the right to receive all of the market rewards. It is possible for multiple people, such as joint activity participants, to own the ownership rights by transferring a portion of the ownership rights. Ownership rights holders can receive a portion of market rewards based on the ownership ratio. This is realized by the fact that the Property Contract that represents ownership rights conforms to ERC20 standard.</p><h3 id="treasury" tabindex="-1">Treasury</h3><p>Property ownership is by default 100% owned by the Property owner. However, the percentage specified by Policy will be sent to Treasury Contract. The <a href="https://github.com/dev-protocol/protocol/blob/main/docs/POLICY.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">current policy is here</a>. Treasury Contract earns/accumulates a portion of the market rewards earned from a Property by holding a portion of the Property tokenized over the protocol. Treasury Contract accumulates Properties and DEV, which are used as financial resources for the community.</p><h3 id="staking" tabindex="-1">Staking</h3><p>Staking is used in Dev Protocol as a new supporting system that enables trading of various Properties. Staking is a mechanism that increases market rewards through the temporary deposit of DEV toward a property. As consideration for staking, the payer receives utility from the activity participant, and the activity participant receives the market rewards that have increased during the staking period. Staking continues while the payer needs this utility, increasing the scarcity value of DEV. By receiving staking, activity participant secure the sustainability of their activity.</p><h3 id="supporting-flow" tabindex="-1">Supporting Flow</h3><p>By staking DEV in a Property over a specific period of time, the supporter receives some sort of perk optionally.<br>Based on the amount of DEV staked, a market reward (inflation) amount is added for the property. The longer the staking period by the payer, the more market rewards are promised to the activity participant.<br>As interest, the supporter receives a portion of the DEV that is newly acquired by the activity participant. The amount that can be received at this time is determined by the amount that the user has staked in comparison with the total amount staked.<br>When the staking period ends, the DEV staked in the property is released, and the user can withdraw it.</p><h3 id="governance" tabindex="-1">Governance</h3><p>Many incentives are built into Dev Protocol so that all users can receive profit without encroaching on each other’s interests. There is no decisive theory on the interaction of these incentives, and our hope is for the community, including stakeholders, to constantly propose improvements. In Dev Protocol, indices with uncertainty are accepted from external sources as part of the policy. And, the <a href="https://github.com/dev-protocol/protocol/blob/main/docs/POLICY.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">current policy is here</a>.</p><h3 id="application-layer" tabindex="-1">Application Layer</h3><p>By staking their DEV toward an activity participant, users receive some sort of perk from this activity participant. (Although it is possible for the staking user to contact the activity participant and request perk in a direct manner) The application layer automatically executes a series of trades. The application layer relays the user’s staking to the activity participant and relays the activity participant’s perk to the user. The motivation to build out an application layer depends on each individual’s intentions, but below are possible motivations.</p><ul><li>Increase the value of DEV owned</li><li>Receive a portion of the rewards by inheriting a portion of the activity participant’s Property</li><li>Collect commission from the user</li></ul><p>If a staking user gets some staking perk, those perks will be provided via the application layers.</p><hr><h3 id="mechanism" tabindex="-1">Mechanism</h3><p>Dev Protocol is comprised of the following 14 main contracts.</p><ul><li>Market Contract</li><li>Market Factory Contract</li><li>Property Contract</li><li>Property Factory Contract</li><li>Metrics Contract</li><li>Policy Contract</li><li>Policy Factory Contract</li><li>Lockup Contract</li><li>Allocator Contract</li><li>Policy Contract</li><li>Policy Factory Contract</li><li>Address Config Contract</li><li>Treasury Contract</li><li>Dev Contract</li></ul><p><a href="/content/en/images/chart-of-contracts.png" target="_self"><img src="/content/en/images/chart-of-contracts.png" alt="Chart" class="p-4"></a></p><h3 id="market-contract" tabindex="-1">Market Contract</h3><p>The Market Contract represents a specific group of properties. The properties handled by Dev Protocol can be defined through the <code>authenticate</code> function.<br>Anybody can freely propose a Market Contract. However, in order for it to take effect, it must be approved through a vote of existing Property Contract owners. The number of votes will be the sum of the count staked in the Property Contract and the <code>totals</code>. Generally, votes are expected to be carried out by property owners, but stake executors can use their own count of stakes as the number of votes in order to vote. In this case, the address of the Property Contract subject to staking will be assigned.<br>The <code>authenticate</code> function authenticates the executor of the function as the owner of the property. For example, a GitHub repository is assigned, and the fact that the executor is the owner of this GitHub repository is authenticated. Therefore, it should not be possible for anybody other than the owner of the Property Contract to execute the <code>authenticate</code> function.

This is a token that conforms to ERC20 and can be transferred to any email address.</p><p>Each Property Contract(Token) holder will receive market rewards based on the balance of the Property Contract(Token) that they own. Calculating the market rewards is the responsibility of the Allocator Contract, whereas receiving the market rewards is the responsibility of the Withdraw Contract. The Property Contract is a pure ERC20.</p><p>The <code>transfer</code> function for the Property Contract requests the Allocator Contract to adjust the amount that can be withdrawn, since the amount of market rewards that can be withdrawn varies based on changes to the balance.</p><p>A Property Contract in its initial state is not assuring assets (e.g., GitHub repositories).</p><p>In order for a Property to be associated with an asset, a Market Contract must be associated with the Property Contract. The association is established by the <code>authenticatedCallback</code> function for the Market Contract. Multiple Market Contracts can be associated with a Property Contract. 1 Property Contract can represent a specific assets group or a Property Contract can be created for each asset.</p><h3 id="property-factory-contract" tabindex="-1">Property Factory Contract</h3><p>The Property Factory Contract generates a new Property Contract.</p><p>The generation of a Property Contract is carried out by executing the <code>create</code> function.

For ease of comparison of Property Contracts, <code>totalSupply</code> is fixed as <code>10000000</code> (in Solidity, it’s <code>10000000000000000000000000</code>), and <code>decimals</code> is fixed as 18.</p><p>When the Property Factory Contract generates a new Property Contract, a portion of the total supply will be allocated to the Treasury Contract.</p><p>Tokens assigned to the Treasury Contract will be used by the Dev Protocol developers team for more flexible use case development or returned to the Property Contract creator.</p><p>The allocation share to the Treasury Contract is determined by the Policy Contract’s <code>shareOfTreasury</code> function. Besides, the Treasury Contract’s address is determined by the <code>treasury</code> function of the Policy Contract.</p><p>Users who do not yet have a Property Contract will want to create a Property Contract and authenticate with a Market Contract at the same time. To do this, the Property Factory Contract exposes the <code>createAndAuthenticate</code> method. The <code>createAndAuthenticate</code> method creates a Property Contract and consistently uses that Property Contract to authenticate with a Market Contract.</p><h3 id="metrics-contract" tabindex="-1">Metrics Contract</h3><p>The Metrics Contract represents the association between Property Contracts and Market Contracts.</p><p>When <code>authenticatedCallback</code> of the Market Contract is called, a Metrics Contract that retains the addresses of the Property Contract and Market Contract is generated.</p><p><code>authenticatedCallback</code> for the Market Contract returns the address for the Metrics Contract.
